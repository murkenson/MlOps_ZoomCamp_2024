### Docker Build Command

```bash
docker build -t ride_predictions .
```

#### Description:
This command creates a Docker image named `ride_predictions` using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`).

- `docker build`: The Docker command to build an image from a Dockerfile.
- `-t ride_predictions`: Tags the resulting image with the name `ride_predictions`.
- `.`: Specifies the build context, which is the current directory. This directory should contain the Dockerfile and any other files needed for the image.

### Docker Run Command

```bash
docker run ride_predictions /bin/bash -c "python score.py yellow 2023 5"
```

#### Description:
This command runs a container from the `ride_predictions` image and executes a Python script (`score.py`) inside the container.

- `docker run`: The Docker command to create and start a new container from an image.
- `ride_predictions`: The name of the image to run.
- `/bin/bash -c "python score.py yellow 2023 5"`: The command to execute inside the container.
  - `/bin/bash`: Starts a bash shell in the container.
  - `-c "python score.py yellow 2023 5"`: Tells the bash shell to execute the command `python score.py yellow 2023 5`.
    - `python score.py`: Runs the `score.py` Python script.
    - `yellow 2023 5`: Arguments passed to the `score.py` script. In this context, it looks like the script is being instructed to process data related to "yellow" (presumably a type of ride or taxi) for the year 2023 and the month of May (5).

#### Summary:
- The `docker build` command creates an image called `ride_predictions` from the current directory.
- The `docker run` command starts a container from the `ride_predictions` image and runs the `score.py` script with specified arguments inside the container.
